##What is Tic Tac Toe
a.-Humans do not find tic-tac-toe to be a particularly difficult game. If you're a real tic-tac-toe fan, you've probably progressed beyond the basic game to something more complex, such as three-dimensional tic-tac-toe on a wider grid. If you sat down right now to play regular three-by-three tic-tac-toe with a pal, every game will almost certainly end in a tie. You and your friend are probably both capable of playing flawlessly, never making a mistake that allows your opponent to win. But can you explain how you figure out where to go in each turn? You probably aren't even aware of other options most of the time; you simply look at the board and know exactly where you want to go. nstant information is beneficial to humans since it allows them to play at a faster pace. However, it is of little use when writing a computer programme. To do so, you must have a clear understanding of your plan
